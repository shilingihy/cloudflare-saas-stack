## Cloudflare SaaS Starter kit

This is a starter kit for quickly building SaaS products on Cloudflare.

To use, simply:

1. Make sure that you have [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/#installupdate-wrangler) installed.

2. Run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dhravya/cloudflare-saas-stack

```

That's it. You're ready to go!

Next time, you can just run `bun run dev` and start developing.

When you're ready to deploy, run `bun run deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare.
